                                answer. He said to him: “Abu has summed up the story.”
                                The worldly tyrant in six verses: “We come to the world as equals, the child of kings as
                                the child of courtiers.”
                                And we leave this world, as you can see, standing together on bare graves. Our deeds
                                raise and lower our status and account
                                Truly, on the Day of Desolation there will be poplars, rivers, high palaces, a burning
                                Hell, and a burning fire, so choose for yourself what you like.

                            <p>The second story:
                                One day there was a parents' meeting in a school, and among the attendees was a teacher
                                who had spent many years of her life studying and learning the teachings of her true
                                religion. She gave a few few words.
                                Which was very valuable and expressive for parents...
                                We should all know...that our master Noah, peace be upon him, did not fail in raising
                                his son or calling him to worship God.
                                He is alone and has no partner. He was a prophet.He had no way to imprint disbelief on
                                his son's heart. And Azer, the father of our master
                                “Abraham,” peace be upon him, did not strive to raise his son and reform him to be a
                                messenger and prophet. And our master “Jacob,” peace be upon him, did not plant in the
                                hearts of his children jealousy, envy, hatred, and hatred toward their little brother
                                “Joseph,” peace be upon him, to the point that they wanted to kill him and get rid of
                                him permanently...</p>
                            <div class="content-r">
                                <p>The whole story lies in the fact that the guidance and righteousness of our children
                                    is in the hands of God Almighty alone, so it is not
                                    we have to
                                    We take pride and attribute to ourselves the guidance and righteousness of our
                                    children and the extent of their literature, and we forget that success in all of
                                    this is in our hands.
                                    God
                                    Alone, and that He, Glory be to Him, the Most High, guides whomever He wills and
                                    grants success to whomever He wills to do what He wills. We don't have to flog

                            <p>National Geographic conducted a very wonderful experiment. They conducted an experiment
                                on two monkeys and placed them in...
                                Two cages next to each other so that they could see each other, and on the first day the
                                keeper gave each monkey one of them
                                A small pebble, and then the guard asks the monkey to retrieve the small pebble and once
                                the monkey returns it
                                He gets a reward from the guard.He did this with the first monkey, and the monkey
                                succeeded in returning the small pebble to the guard, who gave him a piece
                                From the cucumber as a reward, the monkey started dancing because he was so happy with
                                the piece of cucumber and he was enjoying and enjoying eating it.
                                As for the second monkey, the guard gave him a bunch of delicious red grapes as a reward
                                When he retrieved the small pebble from him, the first monkey was then observing the
                                entire situation...</p>
                            <div class="content-r">
                                <p>On the second day, the same experiment was repeated, when the guard gave the first
                                    monkey a small pebble
                                    He asked him to take it back. The monkey returned it to him, but when the guard gave
                                    him a piece of cucumber as a reward, he got up
                                    The monkey threw it in his face; Once again, the guard gave the second monkey a
                                    bunch of red grapes
                                    As a reward for returning the pebble, the first monkey watches carefully.

                                    On the third day, the same experiment was repeated. The first monkey threw the small
                                    pebble at him
                                    The guard without expecting a reward from him in the first place, and again the
                                    guard gave the second monkey a bunch
                                    Grapes as a bonus!</p>

                            <h2>the first story</h2>
                            <p>When our master Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, was stabbed, milk was
                                brought to him and he drank it, but he collapsed. His side, and the doctor said to him:
                                (I advise, O Commander of the Faithful, for you will not live)! Then our master “Omar
                                bin Al-Khattab” called his son “Abdullah” and said to him: (Bring me Hudhayfah bin
                                Al-Yaman), and he was our master. Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman was the only companion whom the
                                Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, entrusted and gave him names.
                                The hypocrites, and thus no one knew the names of these hypocrites after God and His
                                Noble Messenger except “Hudhayfah bin “Aleman”; As soon as Hudhayfah came to him, the
                                Commander of the Faithful, our master Omar bin Al-Khattab, said to him while blood was
                                flowing From his side: (O Hudhayfah, I appeal to you by God, the Most High, the Great,
                                did the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, say my name? between
                                Hypocrites? Then Hudhayfah remained silent with tears streaming from his eyes and said:
                                (The Messenger of God has entrusted me with a secret and I have not
                                I can tell you about it, Omar. Our master Omar bin Al-Khattab said: “O Hudhayfah, for
                                God’s sake, tell me whether
                                Did the Messenger of God tell you my name among them?), and our master Hudhayfah said
                                while crying: I say it to you, O Omar, but I do not say it.
                                To anyone else, by God, your name has not been mentioned to me. Here, “Omar” reassured a
                                little and said to his son, “Abdullah”: My son
                                There is only one thing left for me in this world.” His son asked him: “What is it,
                                father?” He said to him: “Omar,” may God be pleased with him.
                                He satisfied him: “I should be buried next to the Messenger of God. My son, go to Aisha,
                                the Mother of the Believers, and do not say Amir
                                The landlady, if you permit Omar to be buried under the feet of his two companions,
                                The answer of Mrs. “Aisha,” may God be pleased with her, to our master “Abdullah bin
                                Omar” was: (I had
                                I prepared this closeness for myself, and now I leave it to Omar). </p>

                                <p>Our master “Abdullah” returned to his father and said with joy: (O Father, the Mother
                                    of the Believers has given you permission), and behold,
                                    with it
                                    He saw his father's cheek on the dirt, so he approached him and sat next to him and
                                    put his father's cheek on his thigh, so he looked at him.
                                    Our master “Omar” said to him: (Why did you keep my cheek from the dirt?!),
                                    “Abdullah” said: (Oh father), so he said
                                    for him
                                    Our Master “Omar”: (Put your father’s cheek on the dirt so that his face may be
                                    soaked in it. Woe to Omar if his Lord does not forgive him.
                                    tomorrow).

                                    Our master, “Omar bin Al-Khattab,” may God be pleased with him, died after he made a
                                    will to his son, “Abdullah.”
                                    He said it
                                    To him: (If you carry me and pray for me in the mosque of the Messenger of God, then
                                    look at the rows of worshippers, and if you see “Hudhayfah”
                                    Lost
                                    He will be careful with me in saying, so if Hudhayfah prays over me, then carry me
                                    towards the house of the Messenger of God. Then stand on
                                    The door and say, “Mother, your son is Omar,” and do not say “Commander of the
                                    Faithful,” for you may be ashamed of me
                                    So I gave permission
                                    For me, if you do not give me permission, then bury me in the Muslim graves.”
                                    So his son “Abdullah” carried him, and when he found our master “Hudhayfah bin
                                    Al-Yaman” among the worshipers, he rejoiced.
                                    And carry it
                                    To the house of the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, and
                                    “Abdullah” said: (O our mother, your son “Omar” is...
                                    Do you allow him to enter the door? Then Mrs. Aisha said: “Enter him.”

                                    Our master Omar bin Al-Khattab was buried next to his two friends. Our master Omar
                                    bin Al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him
                                    He pleased him, he filled the earth with justice, and despite the fact that the
                                    Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, gave him good tidings
                                    That he is
                                    One of the companions of Paradise, except that he feared God intensely and feared
                                    His torment. What about us?
                                    today?!
                                    We were protected from the punishment of God, and we became dependent on the life of
                                    this world, so we began to have fun, play, and laugh, not knowing if it was our Lord
                                    Are you satisfied with us or not?!
                                </p>

                            <p>The cunning fox There was a large forest, and there was a lion in it that frightened and
                                harmed the animals, so they gathered The animals of the forest decided to cooperate
                                together and confront the lion’s brutality and harm, and they came up with a smart plan
                                to trap him. In a cage, their smart plan succeeded. They trapped the lion and lived
                                happily and safely. And one day Once a little rabbit passed by the cage in which the
                                lion was confined, and the lion said to the rabbit: “Please, rabbit.” الصغير أن تساعدني
                                I have to get out of this cage.” The rabbit replied: “No, I will never let you out
                                You torture animals and eat them.” The lion said, “I promise you that I will not return
                                to these actions, and I will become a friend.”
                                For all the animals, and I will not harm any of them.” The good little rabbit believed
                                the lion’s words and opened to him </p>
                            <div class="content-r">
                                <p></p>He opened the cage door and helped him get out. As soon as the lion came out, he
                                jumped on the rabbit and grabbed him, then he said: "You
                                My first prey for today!” The rabbit started screaming and crying for help in panic, and
                                there it was
                                fox
                                A smart man was close to them, so he heard the rabbit’s cries for help and ran quickly
                                to help him, and when he arrived, he went to
                                the lion
                                He spoke to him, saying: “I heard that you were locked in this cage. Is that so?”
                                TRUE Really?” The lion said: “Yes, the animals locked me in it.” The fox replied: “But I
                                don’t
                                believe
                                So, how can a big and mighty lion like you fit inside this small cage? It seems you are
                                lying
                                Ali.” The lion replied: “I am not lying, and I will prove to you that I was inside this
                                cage.” The lion entered the cage.
                                Once again, in order to prove to the fox that he had room inside him, the fox quickly
                                approached the cage door
                                He closed it tightly, trapped the lion in it again, and then said to the rabbit: “Don’t
                                believe this lion
                                once again" . </p>

                            <h2>the third story</h2>
                            <p>The Lion and the Mouse One day, the king of the jungle, the lion, was sleeping, and a
                                little mouse climbed onto his back and started
                                While playing, the lion felt disturbed by the movement on his back and woke up angry, so
                                he grabbed the mouse and decided to...
                                He ate it directly. The mouse was very frightened and began to apologize to the lion for
                                disturbing him, and begged him to release him or not
                                He ate him, then promised to save him one day if he freed him. The lion laughed
                                sarcastically, so how could a little mouse help?
                                A strong lion, but he decided to leave him. After a few days</p>
                            <div class="content-r">
                                <p>A group of hunters came, caught the lion, and tied it tightly with ropes until they
                                    prepared a cage
                                    To put it in it, the mouse saw the lion in this state and remembered his promise to
                                    him, so he approached him and began to bite
                                    He cut the ropes, and the lion was able to escape and get away from the hunters. The
                                    mouse looked at the lion and said
                                    To him: “Didn’t I tell you that I would save you one day?” The lion regretted his
                                    belittling and mockery of the mouse, and thanked him
                                    So much for saving him.</p>

                            <p>A bird and an elephant in a distant forest full of large, beautiful trees, and many
                                animals
                                And various, a little bird lived with its mother and siblings in a small nest built on
                                the tops of a tree.
                                One day, the bird went to the mother to search for food for her young children who had
                                no food
                                They can fly, and while she was away from the nest, a strong wind blew and shook the
                                nest, and the little bird fell
                                On the ground. The little bird had not yet learned to fly, so it remained in its place,
                                frightened, waiting for it to return
                                His mother, and during that time, a good elephant passed by, walking cheerfully in the
                                forest, hitting the ground with his big feet.And singing loudly, the bird was frightened
                                It was intense, and he started trying to hide from the elephant, but...
                                The elephant saw him and said to him: “Are you okay, beautiful little bird? Did you fall
                                from the tree?” But
                                The bird was very afraid and could not answer the elephant. It was shivering greatly
                                from fear and cold, so it became sad.
                                The elephant decided to bring some leaves and put them around him to keep him warm. A
                                cunning fox came and saw the elephant
                                He talks to the bird and then goes away to bring him the papers. He approached the bird
                                when the elephant was gone.
                                The little bird that he fell from
                                Nest, the fox said cunningly: “I know where your nest is, bird, and I will return you to
                                it, but you must...
                                The beginning is to get rid of the elephant, as it is an evil animal and wants to harm
                                you.” At this moment, the elephant came back carrying
                                Leaves, so the fox moved away and hid behind the trees watching the bird. The elephant
                                placed the leaves around the bird.
                                And who felt</p>
                            <div class="content-r">
                                <p>With warmth, then he said to the elephant: “Oh good elephant, I feel hungry. Can you
                                    bring me some
                                    Food?” This was the bird’s idea to keep the elephant away from him so that the fox
                                    could return him to his nest
                                    And his brothers, the elephant is big and very scary, but the fox looks good and has
                                    beautiful fur.
                                    With wonderful colors, the elephant replied: “Sure, bird, I will bring you some
                                    grains, but be patient
                                    Be careful of other animals and do not move from your place until I return.” The fox
                                    approached the bird at
                                    The elephant went and said to him: "Let's go, so I can return you to your nest,
                                    bird." He carried him and moved away behind him الشجرة، وفجأة تغيرت ملامح الثعلب،
                                    ورمى العصفور على الأرض ثمّ هجم عليه لافتراسه
                                    As he ate it, the bird began to scream loudly: “Save me! Please save me!” The
                                    elephant heard the bird's voice
                                    He quickly returned and saw the fox trying to prey on the bird, so he ran quickly
                                    and hit the fox, which fled
                                    Walking away, the elephant picked up the bird and said to him: “Didn’t I tell you
                                    not to go away, bird?” I confess
                                    The bird: “Actually, I was afraid of you, elephant. You are big, huge, and huge.
                                    And I am a very small bird.” The elephant replied with great sadness: “Bird, I do
                                    not eat animals.”
                                    Little one, I only want to help you, and you must learn that no one should be judged
                                    by... By its shape or size, but only by its actions.” Then the elephant took the
                                    bird and returned it to the tree that had fallen
                                    From her, and his mother was looking for him with great fear, so she was very happy
                                    when she saw him, and thanked the elephant for his help
                                    for him

                            <p>The Fox and the Grapes There was a little fox walking in the forest, and suddenly he saw
                                a bunch of grapes hanging from the tree.
                                one of the high branches, and he said: “This is what I needed to quench my thirst,” the
                                fox said to himself happily, then
                                He took a few steps back and jumped, trying to catch the cluster, but he failed, so he
                                tried a second and third time.
                                He continued trying to no avail, and finally, after losing hope, the fox walked away
                                from the tree.
                                He says arrogantly: “They are fruits</p>

                                    The quiet one had no fruit in it, and the ground is dirty, and the branches are

                                    The quiet tree, which has no fruit to eat, and no strong branches to use for
                                    making the furniture.

                                    In addition, the quiet tree is inhabited by many animals and birds, and the men did

                            <p>A story about health and safety for children
                                Once upon a time, gentlemen, gentlemen, a boy named Atef and his friend named Hazem were
                                playing with each other in a courtyard.
                                School and they go home together every day after school, and one day after
                                Hazem and Atef left school. Atef went to the candy cart to buy candy as he used to do
                                every day, but...
                                Hazem tried to stop him and told him, Atef, we should not eat such foods, as they are
                                unhealthy for me
                                Absolutely, and it harms us. Yesterday, I heard the doctor on television talking about
                                the value of eliminating healthy foods and the harm of sweet foods
                            </p>

                                    are cheap and delicious
                                    The taste is beautiful and delicious. I will eat it, but you are free. I cannot make
                                    you eat it against your will.
                                    Indeed, Atef went to the cart and bought the colorful sweets that looked very
                                    bright, and ate them
                                    Immediately, he kept saying to his friend, “Didn’t I tell you that it is delicious
                                    and delicious? What a beautiful sweet,” and after a short time
                                    Before arriving home, Atef felt severe pain in his stomach and screamed loudly, so
                                    his friend tried to help him
                                    He went to his parents immediately and brought them to the place where Atef was, and
                                    when they arrived at the hospital, he told them</p>

                                Eat healthy food that builds the body, strengthens bones and muscles, makes children

                                    I want them to get used to it from the first day they eat, and I am always keen to

                                During the harvest season, a man does not eat any of his produce before distributing
                                part of it to the poor
                                He gave charity to those in need, and he enjoyed the blessings of his charity and the

                                the poor and needy.
                                The blessing and continuity of money comes from these actions. </p>

                                    Giving alms to the poor and feeding them reduces the harvest, and they are the ones
                                    who are tired of farming

                                    harvest the orchard before it came to them.
                                    The poor do not even give them

                                    surprised that their orchard looked like fire.
                                    I burned it

                                People make the pilgrimage to it just as the Arabs make the pilgrimage to the Holy
